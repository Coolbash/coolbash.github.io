<p class=MsoNormal>The Big Bang Theory is quite strong nowadays. Almost nobody questions
it, no matter a scientist or just a person. But is it really so unquestionable?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reason of the theory is the Red Shift. The farther away
a source of light, the more the Red Shift of the light. The scientists believe
that the reason of the Red Shift is the Doppler Effect. The more the Red Shift,
the more speed with which the object is moving away from us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what if the Red Shift has a different cause?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The farther a source of light, the older photons that we
receive from the object. Who knows what happens with photons during billions of
years? What if a photon loses its energy with age somehow? If so, then with
time (and space) it should lower its frequency. Hence the Red Shift.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We don't have any theory of &quot;aging photons&quot;. If such
a process has place in life it will be quite hard to prove it. But it's also
hard to prove that any photon won't change its energy in billions of years.
Until then, this idea has right to be considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if photons really lose their energy somehow with time (and
space) then it's possible that the Universe is not expanding. And there was never
any Big Bang. And the Background radiation caused not by a Big Bang but just
sources of light that are so far away that photons from them lose so much
energy that some gamma-photons become microwave ones. I personally found that
theory much more logical than the Expanding Universe that was created from a
tiny spot in a Big Explosion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have this Idea for a long time but only recently had an idea
about how photons can lose its energy. Recent <a
href="https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW190521">gravitational-waves
detecting experiments</a> helped me with it. They discovered collision of two
black holes, 85 and 66 masses of the Sun had collided into big black hole with
the mass of 142 Sun masses. The remnant mass of 8 Sun masses was converted into
the gravitational-wave signal. Huge mass was converted into gravitational-wave.
At least it proves that gravitational waves exist carry energy and any body
that emits them must lose some energy. But what bodies emit gravitational waves?
I assume, any bodies that have mass and move must emit gravitational waves but
I don't actually know any consistent theory about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if any moving body with a mass emits loses its energy by
emitting gravitational waves, what about photons? Do they emit gravitational
waves? It's a good question but why not? We know that photons don't have any
rest mass. But they do have relativistic mass. We can even calculate it thanks
to Einstein. We also see that photons behave like they have a mass: they can't
escape gravitational field of a black hole; they have momentum and can push objects
(the radiation pressure); they bent toward any big mass. So, if they are pulled
by any object with mass, it's logical that they must pull other objects (it's
not a prove, it's just an assumption). Hence, they must emit gravitational
waves, hence, lose their energy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'll try to explain it differently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's imagine a big heavy object that moves in space with
very big speed, near the speed of light. Let's name it Marvin. How long will it
keep its speed (energy)? Theoretically it can move without changing speed
forever in some empty space. But in real life, in real Universe it must go by
other bodies (that have much less speed of course). Let's assume that Marvin
doesn't hit anything and let's don't pay attention to its trajectory. Just focus
on its speed (kinetic energy). How will it change? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We know that any big masses cause tidal forces that can heat
up bodies and slower their relative speed and rotation. Therefore, when Marvin would
go by any significant mass, it must lose its energy to tidal forces. Hence, it
must lose its speed. But what if the mass of Marvin is not so big? Or it
doesn't go quite clos to anything? At what mass or <span class=GramE>distance</span>
the tidal forces stop working? I believe that the answer is &quot;never&quot;.
Tidal forces never stop. They just become very little. It means that our Marvin
would lose its speed with time in any case. Doesn't matter its mass or distance
to other bodies. It might change the speed of the process but not the process
itself. Marvin will lose its energy eventually. Even if Marvin has very little
mass. So little that it becomes a photon. But, of course, a photon can't lose
its speed. If it must lose its energy, it'll lose its frequency. It must be a
very slow process, but in thousands of years the lost energy may become measurable
by our instruments. And in billions of years the photon might lose almost all
of its energy…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm not trying to say that the Big Bang Theory is wrong. But
I think other ideas also worth considering. The cosmology has several unsolved
problems nowadays. Some people even say about a crisis in cosmology. Maybe the
reason of the crisis is in a wrong theory…</p>
